Functional Interface:
An Interface that contains only one abstract method is known as functional interface.
It can have any number of default and static methods.
It can also declare methods of object class.

Optional
Java introduced a new class Optional in Java 8. 
It is a public final class which is used to deal with NullPointerException in Java application. 
We must import java.util package to use this class. It provides methods to check the presence of value for particular variable

What Is a Java Stream?
A Java stream is a pipeline of functions that can be evaluated. Java streams are not a data structure and cannot mutate data; they can only transform data.

Q:- Intermediate Operations

filter() -  which allows elements that match the predicate,
count() - which counts the number of items in a stream,
map() - which applies a function in each element of Stream for transformation, and 
collect() - which collects the final result of Stream processing into a Collection.
***Hello guys, I have been writing about some important methods from Java SE 8  like map(), flatMap(), collect(), etc for quite some time, and today I'll share my experience with another useful method peek() from java.utill.stream.Stream class.

Interface Private Methods
we can create private methods inside an interface. 
Interface allows us to declare private methods that help to share common code between non-abstract methods.

Try With Resource Enhancement
Java introduced try-with-resource feature in Java 7 that helps to close resource automatically after being used.
In other words, we can say that we don't need to close resources (file, connection, network etc) explicitly, try-with-resource close that automatically by using AutoClosable interface.

Factory Methods
Factory methods are special type of static methods that are used to create unmodifiable instances of collections
It is unmodifiable, so adding new element will throw java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException
List<String> list = List.of("Java","JavaFX","Spring","Hibernate","JSP"); 
Set<String> set = Set.of("Java","JavaFX","Spring","Hibernate","JSP");  

takeWhile
The takeWhile() method in Java streams is used to create a new stream consisting 
of elements from the original stream that match a given predicate.

The dropWhile() method in Java streams is the complement of takeWhile(). 
It creates a new stream by discarding elements from the beginning of the original stream until a predicate is no longer satisfied, and then includes the remaining elements.

Running Java File with single command
One major change is that you donâ€™t need to compile the java source file with javac tool first.
You can directly run the file with java command and it implicitly compiles.

HTTP Client
The new HttpClient can be used either synchronously or asynchronously.
A synchronous request blocks the current thread until the reponse is available.
BodyHandlers define the expected type of response body (e.g. as string, byte-array or file):
