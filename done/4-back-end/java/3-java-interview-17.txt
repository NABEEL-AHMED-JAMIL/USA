Q: what new in java 17?
A:
1) Sealed Classes [Control which classes or interfaces can extend or implement them.] how they restrict inheritance:
we can add any method in the sealed class
*** like abstract method also & // ‚ùå Compilation error! if we try to extend with no permit class
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}

2) Pattern Matching for instanceof (Standard) [Removes the need for manual casting]
Simplifies type checks and casting.
// in old we do the meanul caseing when try to compare the match
Object obj = "Hello Java";
if (obj instanceof String) {
    String s = (String) obj;  // manual cast
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
}

New way
if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.toLowerCase());
}

3) Records
Java records don't have setters because they are designed to be immutable. That means once you create a record, its values cannot be changed.
Immutable by default, Final fields, Auto-generated constructor, getters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString()

4) Switch Expressions
